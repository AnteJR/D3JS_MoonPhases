# D3. Moon Phases

 A D3.js artful data-driven project that displays the moon phases from my birth year of 1997 to the present day of 2022.

## Data and its collection

[Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/?year=20229) was used to get the data from the moon phases. I had to enter manually all the 4 phases of the moon, and the year, month and day they occured.

I also took a note of the percentage of lighting the moon is recieving, which I converted to a multiple of pi (from 0 to 2), and what direction the shadow faces.
